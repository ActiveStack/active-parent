misc notes:

* Maven Wrapper:      
   Normally you instruct users to run the mvn command like the following:
  
        $ mvn clean package
     But now, with a Maven Wrapper setup, you can instruct users to run wrapper scripts:
  
         $ ./mvnw clean package
     or
  
         $ ./mvnw.cmd clean package
     A normal Maven build will be executed with the one important change that if the user doesn't have the necessary 
     version of Maven specified in `.mvn/wrapper/maven-wrapper.properties` it will be downloaded for the user first.     
     
     (Note: Initial maven-wrapper files were setup as per: [maven-wrapper](https://github.com/takari/maven-wrapper),
      using: `mvn -N io.takari:maven:wrapper`.)
